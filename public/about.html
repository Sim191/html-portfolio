<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Simone, a web developer based in Plymouth, UK. I enjoy making websites that people love to visit. Browsing the Internet should be a fun experience!</p>

<p>When I'm not developing and designing websites, you can find me playing peekaboo with my 5 month old daughter and my fianc√©. If not, I'm probably buried in stories in the library as I adore reading with my whole being.</p>

<p>Designing websites is a new skill of mine, but I'm loving it so far! Thank you for checking out my portfolio today. </p>
